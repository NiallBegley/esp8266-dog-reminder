# esp8266-dog-reminder
## Overview

This is a very simple application for the ESP8266 that reminds me that my dog is outside by periodically sending push notifications to my phone.

Press a button to awake the ESP8266 and once awoken the device will periodically send a push notification to the given PushOver account.  You flip a switch to put the device into deep sleep mode once done.
